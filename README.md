This repo is scheduled for massive changes :D

# Skip this boring process and just get BeX on Google Chrome http://goo.gl/Ewd2XN


# BeamExtended
Extend the unextended potential of Beam!

This extension will expand the use of Beam.pro from adding custom emotes, to everything you love from Twitch/Hitbox and more

## Installation and Use

To get the extension, first make sure your bookmark bar is visible!

``ctrl+shift+b`` or ``cmd+shift+b`` in chrome to show your bar

``Right Click open space in URL bar and choose SHOW BOOKMARK BAR``

### Create a new bookmark!

Right Click your bar and choose `"Add Page"` or ``"Create Bookmark"``

![Alt text](http://puu.sh/fIMML/98ee27d9e9.jpg)

Add BeamExtended or BEX as the name and this copied exactly as the URL:

``javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://ec87d41a87dde68618f3f11fc9c3e4fde11820dc.googledrive.com/host/0B0aYi6iDIlBaSGxJNkFTeEhqMmM/contentscript.js');}());``

Hit Save!

Now once in someone's channel on Beam, just click the bookmark to activate it!

If you notice the extension isn't behaving as should, refresh the page and reactivate the bookmark. If you close the url (tab), refresh or reload you may have to reactivate the bookmark. :)
