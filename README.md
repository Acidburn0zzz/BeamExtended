Add BeamExtended or BEX as the name and this copied exactly as the URL:

``javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://ec87d41a87dde68618f3f11fc9c3e4fde11820dc.googledrive.com/host/0B0aYi6iDIlBaSGxJNkFTeEhqMmM/contentscript.js');}());``

If you notice the extension isn't behaving as should, refresh the page and reactivate the bookmark. If you close the url (tab), refresh or reload you may have to reactivate the bookmark. :)
